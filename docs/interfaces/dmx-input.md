### DMX Input

!!! info "Version Info"
    As of version v0.16 supports DMX input via MAX485. This is great when ArtNet or e1.31/sACN over WIFI is not suitable 

#### features and limitations

* one universe (512 channels)
  

#### software setup

For the DMX feature to work, you'll need to use the V4 build variants. Define *all* the pins you are using in the DMX input section of the Sync Interfaces menu

The wired DMX will work exactly like the network DMX options, only a single universe, so see [e1.31-dmx](/interfaces/e1.31-dmx/) for details of the different DMX modes

#### hardware setup

The DMX interface require the use of an RS485 adapter such as the MAX485 transceiver connected to the pins defined in setup of the ESP in order to handle DMX input and RDM input and output.


You will need to use *three* GPIO pins that support output.

*Do NOT use the pins on your ESP32 labelled RX and TX as your DMX pins!*

* pin assined as *DMX* RX pin on esp32 connects to RO
* pin assined as *DMX* TX pin on esp32 connects to DI
* pin assined as *DMX* EN pin on esp32 connects to both DE and RE

Connect the RS485 power pins as follows

* 5v or 3.3v pin to VCC
* GND to GND

#### background info


For information about the use of DMX with ESP8266, you might like to read [this](https://robertoostenveld.nl/art-net-to-dmx512-with-esp8266/) tutorial by [Robert Oostenveld](https://robertoostenveld.nl/). Note this is just background information about the hardware and you do not need any of the code listed here when using WLED output.
